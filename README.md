# Camera2API
- The Camera2 API is a low-level Android camera package that provides developers with greater control over camera functionality compared to the older Camera API. It allows for advanced features like manual exposure control, RAW image capture, and access to camera capabilities. While CameraX is generally recommended for simpler use cases, Camera2 is preferred for complex scenarios requiring fine-grained control.
